# Clyp-Android

Welcome to the repository for Clyp's Open-Source Android client!

## Getting Started
Looking to contribute to the project? There are a few ways you can help!
- Testing Unstable versions and reporting bugs
- Documenting functions and features of the app
- Optimizing functions and cleaning code
- Organizing the threads and Wiki

and counting! Let's run you through how to do any of these tasks.

### Testing Unstable Versions
Whether you're a developer, or love the blood rushing feeling of the "bleeding-edge",
we'd love to have you help test new features and functionality in the app.

There are two ways to install an unstable version of Clyp on your Android device.
If you have AndroidStudio along drivers for your device, you can clone the codebase
to your local computer and open it in AndroidStudio. Then it's just a matter of connecting
your Android device and hitting run!

No Computer? No problem! We will soon upload the Beta versions to Google Play and
provide a link here to enroll in the Beta. Alpha versions may not be
up to date on Google Play depending on the speed of development on the repository.
The only way to access the absolute latest and greatest is to grab the
code from the repository and build the Apk yourself.

### Documenting Functions and Features
As the codebase grows, it will be increasingly more important for functions
to be documented. We keep track of what things do in-source, by commenting code
thoroughly throughout functions, and briefly above the functions.

As helpful as this is to the developers, keeping this documentation in check
and up to date is work. The task consists of simply checking if the comments match
with the things occuring in code, and if not, opening a thread and calling on the people
who've contributed to the file. The last few contributors to any file leave their names
up top for you.

### Optimizing and cleaning code
This task will require a stronger knowledge of Java and Android, but it is very crucial.
To help continually make Clyp run smoother, faster, and more effectively on Android,
optimization and cleaning is necessary. You can help in refactoring over complex functions down
into smaller recyclable functions, or re-implementing existing functions to improve their
effeciency in some form. The work here often needs to be discussed and planned, and is the
result of some conversation in a thread. Make sure to create threads with your suggestions
and discuss the best way to do things before implementing any code.

This task also includes writing tests for functions. If you've got some time
to kill, we can always do with more tests.

### Organizing Threads and Wiki
This task will require prior consulting and some prior contribution to the project
but is just as important as the other tasks. Threads are comparable to mosquitos,
they increase exponentially. To help keep these mosquito-threads in check, we need
users who are able to find threads that are similar and combine them into one thread
closing the other. This way the thread count is kept to a minimum, all issues get
addressed, and nobody gets stung!

## Not seeing what you're looking for?
Pull up a thread! No better way to communicate than a good ol' thread. Address your
what you're looking for here and we'll do our best to help you out. Please ensure that
you are descriptive!
